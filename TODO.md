- [x] Make the c code recompile on every build
- [ ] Enable interpreting by running aves_interpreter, following the TODOs in that file.
- [ ] Complete fill_in_samples.sh, generating the other forms of IR and the expected output files.
- [ ] Modify test_roundtrip.sh to test the `.aves_text` forms of the programs as well, making sure they result in the same bytecode. Also, have it check the output of interpreting both forms. Rename the script to `runtests.sh`.
- [ ] Work on all the remaining TODOs.
